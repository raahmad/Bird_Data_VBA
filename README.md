# Bird_Data_VBA

### Purpose
Finding and counting unique items and using charts in Excel VBA.   

### Assignment
I have been given raw data by a group of ornithologists. The data was collected on one day’s outing counting birds of special interest to the group. They were using 
an app specially designed for counting these populations. Each time they saw a specific bird, they would touch an icon on their app. For example, if the ornithologist saw three Canadian Geese flying, they would touch the icon three times and three separate instances of “Canadian Goose” would be logged for that user. These results are recorded in the raw_data worksheet

### What to do
1. Download and save file
2. raw_data worksheet contains orignal data received by the ornithologists
3. Click Bird Summary Button in the dashboard worksheet
4. Button will programatically total the species count for each unique species along with creating a bar chart in the summary worksheet

### Where to see code
1. Open the file
2. Click alt + F11
3. Can view VBA code to run program
